# IT-Risk-Predictor-AP
A risk management project assessing a firm's compliance through accuracy reports and matrix representation.

First, through a simple python code, random audit data has been generated as a csv file. (audit_data.csv)
A jupyter notebook is then launched to perform the following operations:
1. Data Manipulation
2. ML operations
3. Visualization
4. Loading
5. Training
6. Testing
7. Accuracy
8. Confusion Matrix
9. Prediction Models for compliance.

This projects aims to target the benefits of automated compliance reports, that later, help is judgement calls taken with respect to employees.
Further, a thorough risk analysis can be completed through these model reports.

As the the project aims to maximize accuracy in terms of risk prediction and management, a RandomForestClassifier has been opted as the ML model of prediction, due to its ensemble nature, ease of metric response and preprocessing steps, along with reduction in overfitting.
